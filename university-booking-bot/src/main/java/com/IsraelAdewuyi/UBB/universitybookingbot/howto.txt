-------How to create inline buttons in Telegram-------
InlineKeyboardMarkup keyboardMarkup = new InlineKeyboardMarkup();
List<List<InlineKeyboardButton>> rowsInlinee = new ArrayList<>();

1. Create a row with bottons
List<InlineKeyboardButton> rowInline = new ArrayList<>();

2. Create a list of bottons and set the text and call back...?
InlineKeyboardButton newKey = new InlineKeyboardButton();

newKey.setText(String);
newKey.setCallbackData(String);
rowInline.add(newKey);
rowsInlinee.add(rowInline);

keyboardMarkup.setKeyboard(rowsInlinee);

sendMessage.setReplyMarkup(keyboardMarkup);

---------- TO_DO ------------
1. In the callback query,if a student fetched from DB is empty, what to do?
2. Studentservice... getStudentById
3. Authenticate the users... make sure only users that are students can use the bot
    or launch any command asides the start
4. When I place a booking and it shows the available rooms, pressing twice places two
    bookings in the DB.

------------ MVP -----------
Date and time feature
Book room feature
Remove all the redundant text
Authorization


------ Nice to have ---------
